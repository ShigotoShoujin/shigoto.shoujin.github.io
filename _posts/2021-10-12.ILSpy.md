### ILSpy
In the draft UI, adding controls to an instance of the DialogWindow class requires telling each control about the parent window handle, since the actual window is created inside the CTor without the WS_VISIBLE style.

This is displeasing, but what are the alternatives?

Maybe letting the DialogWindow instantiate them.

But how does the .NET framework do it?

Enter [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy).

And the actual window handle creation, which requires to know about the parent handle, is done when the control is added to the parent's collection.

Until that, the control instance acts as holder of the properties that will be used for the creation.

This needs to be done in the UI.
