### Understanding Jekyll
The first step into fixing the misunderstanding which prevent the blog from working is to start previewing the pages locally. See [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)

Starting from the working demo blog and isolating the issue, the following observation can be made
- The correct file name format is "yyyy-mm-dd-title.md". By reflex a ".title" was used instead of "-title"
- The category in the header does matter, it has to be "jekyll update". More research can be made on how to use categories.
- The date in the header is used to determine where the blog file will be in the site folders, and not the date from the file name.
- Posts can be added with a future date, and will only be visible later.
- The file extension does not matter between .markdown and .md
